# And we're off!

Okay! Reading the devlogs of other folks was pretty helpful. As was a very helpful meeting with our 5706 sherpa. It's good to know I'm not in as bad a spot as I had thought. 

## The Plan

The Plan was good. The plan was great. It was going to make my academic and personal life easier and I was looking forward to it. 

I started as an RA about four years ago. I got a rep for being freaky good with data in a weird way. Cleaning. Patterns. Bridging language with logic with the social through the machinations of tech (in which the language, logic, social also feature). Did I mention that, as I have zero advanced tech skills, this was all manual? It's okay, though. I got pretty good with Excel, Notepad++, and basic regex. Repetitive work is sometimes a nice break from "big" work. It's different "big" and it's sort of meditative. (Last year, I catalogued, cleaned, and reconciled ~800 Star Trek novels and their metadata in ten days. Because it was fun. Dorky and fun.) Buuuuut. At some point, I started getting legit jobs. Which is sort of intimidating, as Impostor Syndrome is equally as legit a thing as a contract with a CRC. The data I was being given got more and more complicated. And what do you do with data that is terrible? Make patterns, Laura. Code the data, Laura. Make more patterns, Laura! It stopped being fun recently. I knew there was a better way and that the data could do a lot more than my jury-rigging approach could ever develop. 

I just got through another round of this with some Q Anon tweets. There were 40,000 of them and the data was a mess. The search parameters for the tweets were 

`"(Q OR #WWG1WGA OR wwg1 OR wga) ("your researh" OR "do your research" OR #doyourresearch OR "do youre research" OR #doyoureresearch OR "where is the research: OR "rabbit hole" OR #rabbithole OR #downtherabbithole OR "follow the white rabbit" OR #followthewhiterabbit OR "great awakening: OR #greatawakening OR storm OR #thestorm)`

Can you see the potential for problems here? Lingustically? Technologically? Socially? General-thinking-ly? In addition to the fact that there were a lot of "impressions" factored into the parameters, I should probably also mention that this spanned three periods of time. During these three periods of time, both hurricane and conference season occurred. Guess what happens during those times, respectively? *Storms* and *Q* & A sessions - the latter of which were largely done via Twitter, given that there was a plague on this year. Sigh. Problematic, presumptuous, off-topic data. So, so dirty. 

Fast forward: I survived. It took a lot of time. The data really got to me, given how long I was immersed in it. And, ultimately, I was determined never to do this sort of work manually again. Enter HIST 5706.

I started this project with a good chunk of data. I am convinced that distant reading methods can be applied in a way (cross-referenced across a couple models, maybe?) that works with the kind of data I work with. I have a specific adaptation in mind. I've seen the results of other research and know the parts that need a tweak, given my desired orientation. That all said, I should probably learn the ins and outs of the methods proper first. And, damn, was I game!

## The (Incredibly Foreseeable) Plot Wrinkle

I've been game for a couple years. That doesn't change that I got burnt out and did fun tutorials (Ren'Py, I love you) rather than the R tutorials I should have done for this work. 

## The Dumb Choices

I started picking away at the tutorials. I started Good Studenting. I stopped listening to the advice that our 5706 sherpa and my wonderful classmates gave me and started rolling that boulder up the hill. This was the time. I had support from people who are also working on digital projects for the first time ever and now was the time to do this thing. 

Whatever I've run into with the tutorials was easy to navigate. There was a lot of great problem-solving done in Discord and it was a very good friend to me. I really have no excuse not to triumph. I kept on. And on. And on.

## The Official Plot Twist

And then I realised I wasn't having fun. And things weren't really going in the direction I had intended. And the data still gave me shudders. And that I wouldn't be well enough into this by the time we had to be submitting things for this class. And thud.

## The Fix

So stop. This isn't hard. I called once again on my wonderful peers and met with The Sherpa. After both meet-ups, I found I was happy again. I think it's pronounced "smeyeling"? Or "smile-ing"? Maybe "smililng". Whatever. It goes on your face at the mouthal area and looks like a squished letter U.

## The Resolution

I'm doing a story instead. Likely Ren'Py, but maybe Twine. Maybe even with sound. We'll see what this looks like. I have a couple ideas for plot, but that's about it. Nothing firm and nothing more than a half-thought here and there. 

Nobody needed to read this. This is rather a lot. But this devlog is really just for me. Type the things. Acknowledge the things. Come back to them later when I know more about other things and am maybe better prepared to approach this from a place that isn't adjacent to terror/misery. So...

## The End

...I'm choosing fun.
